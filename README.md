[World Reading Tour](https://awarnes.github.io/world-reading-tour)

A site for helping me track reading at least one book from each country in the world.

# Data

### Books

Book recommendations were taken primarily from [WhichBook](https://www.whichbook.net/world-map/).

> Note: I'm not sure exactly what their metric is for determining a book associated with a given country. In many cases it seems to be just that the subject matter involves the country in some way. My primary purpose is to read stories by authors from the country and secondarily books most popular in said country.

I've supplemented the data from WhichBook where either data couldn't be found or where the associated books didn't seem to fit criteria with the list of books compiled by author Ann Morgan at her site [A year of reading around the world](https://ayearofreadingtheworld.com/thelist/).

In the future additional books may be pulled from this list or others:
